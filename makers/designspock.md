# Design Spock

Three years ago I created a Twitter handle called [Design Spock](https://twitter.com/designspock). I thought it would be a fun way to reward designers for sharing their work on Twitter. My hope is this would act as a little encouragement to push people to produce and share more of their work.

There is an early example of an image I designed to accompany each tweet.

Unfortunately, this approach was just too time intensive to sustainably maintain the account. It took 20+ minutes to copy the image into a template, design an associated gradient, come up with a message, and copy/paste the Vulcan salutes.

In the end, I produced about 10 tweets that got a moderate amount of engagement. People appreciated the encouragement, it just wasn't sustainable.

So I've recently decided to rethink the approach to create something that is easier to maintain without undermining the value. I decided to go with a purely text based `quoted retweet` which will allow me to produce a tweet in about a minute. Here is the template:

`{TWO WORD DESCRIPTION}`. This design merits `{NUM}` Vulcan salute(s). ðŸ––
`{#HASHTAG}` `{#HASHTAG 2}`

Here are a few examples:

- [Brand Design](https://twitter.com/DesignSpock/status/1340689551610662912)

I believe this parody profile is considered fair use under copyright law. But if the Star Trek people aren't happy with this usage, I'll rebrand.
