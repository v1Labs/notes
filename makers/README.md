# Supporting Makers

I see makers as modern day inventors. They are scouts exploring the [adjacent possible](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible.html) to push technology forward one discovery at a time.

Unfortunately, makers rarely capitalize on their mini inventions. For a maker, creating value is often more satisfying than extracting value. So I'm going to make an effort to support people who are investing in our collective future.

Here are a few of the things I'd like to do for makers:

- I'm going to start with a small $50/mo budget to support as many people as possible. This will likely result in $1/mo Patreon subscriptions.
- I'll share notes for maker discoveries here to help with feedback, documentation and distribution.
- I'll create a Twitter list of makers to share their accomplishments.
