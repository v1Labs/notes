# Typography

Typography is a pretty fascinating design element. Sometimes you use type as more of an art form. The intent is for the viewer to pause and take time to appreciate the shape of the characters, the color, the composition. Type can be art in a very pure sense.

On the other hand, type is often used as a functional design element. When used for function (a.k.a. reading), the viewer should not be held back by frivolous knick knacks. The viewer's mind should be oblivious to the design and purely focused on the ideas conveyed by the symbols.

I see myself as more of a functional designer. I tend to focus more on utility than art. But these notes will be an exploration of both. I'm no expert when it comes to type but hopefully I can make a few meaningful controbutions.
