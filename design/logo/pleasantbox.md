# The Pleasant Box Logo

[The Pleasant Box](https://www.instagram.com/thepleasantbox/) is a fitness and nutrition project my wife is starting to empower women by publishing home gym workouts and meal hacks. We're working on a logo design that has a few feminine attributes without shying away from attributes that have traditionally been viewed as masculine. This will be a visual hint encouraging women not to feel bound by sexist stereotypes. Women should be free to be strong, powerful and whatever or whoever they want to be.

## Version 1

The idea here is to create a 3D box shape that is also a rose. The font is a bold serif (Arboria) featuring all caps and a heavy weight. The purple highlight brings a more feminine quality to the design.

I think I like this design but we're going to need more time to really test it out. Maybe we'll eventually iterate on this concept or maybe we'll go a different direction.
