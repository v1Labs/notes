# NFL Standings Table Demo

This is a [demo I created a few years ago](https://rl7v3jw3jo.csb.app/) that I recently stumbled upon. It's essentially my take on how the NFL should build their standings screen. By default you just see both conferences sorted by most wins. The table includes the win/loss record for each team, their net points, and the current win/loss streak.

If you click the offense or defense tab, the table data animates to show stats for either category. I believe this is a nice use of progressive disclosure. You only need to visually parse the information you care about, everything else is hidden until you want it.
