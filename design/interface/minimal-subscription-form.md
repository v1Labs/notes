# Designing a Minimal Subscription Form

I often think about how constraints impact design. Without constraints, design becomes lazy, verbose, bloated, and uninspiring. With constraints, design is forced to overcome obstacles. Concessions are made in order to satisfy the necessary function. ConstraintsÂ make designs simple and elegant.

Whenever you build something new, consider imposing constraints, even if they purely self-imposed.

In this example, I'd like to build an email subscription box for [The Pleasant Box](https://thepleasantbox.com). The constraint I'm imposing is to radically minimize space allocated for the form. I'm trying to avoid a wall of micro-copy and a workflow that depends on modals or redirects.

With a minimally invasive subscription form, we'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of where to plug this thing into the app. It'll also work well for various mobile uses.

## Version 1

This isn't a terrible start. The copy isn't obvious enough and the animation could use work.

The nice thing about this design is I've condensed a 3-step workflow into the space of a single input element.

## Version 2
