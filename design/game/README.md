# Game Design

I used to design a few Flash & HTML5 games. I plan to get back into it at some point. I'll probably build web-based solo [worker placement games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement). I've always found these games to be fascinating and they aren't particularly difficult to build. So why not?
